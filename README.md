# Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow/Keras
This repository contains code for anomaly detection using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with TensorFlow/Keras. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator trained on time-series data.

## Dependencies
The code is written in Python and requires the following libraries:
numpy
pandas
tensorflow
matplotlib
These dependencies can be installed via pip using the following command:

## Copy code
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib
## Usage
### Data Preparation:
The training and test data should be in CSV format with each row representing a time-series sample.
Load the training data using pd.read_csv(), drop any unnecessary columns (such as timestamps), and convert it to a numpy array.
### Model Definition:
Define the architecture of the MADE model (for anomaly score calculation), the generator, and the discriminator using the provided functions (made_model, generator_model, discriminator_model).
### Training MADE Model:
Train the MADE model using the train_made function by providing the model, training data, number of epochs, and batch size.
### Training GAN Models:
Train the GAN models using the train_gan function by providing the generator, discriminator, training data, number of epochs, and batch size.
### Anomaly Detection:
Perform anomaly detection using the anomaly_detection function by providing the trained MADE model, generator, and test data. Anomalies are detected based on likelihood scores.
### Main Function:
In the main function, load the training and test data, instantiate the models, train the MADE model, train the GAN models, and perform anomaly detection on the test data.
### Execution:
Run the script by executing the main function. Ensure that the paths to the training and test data files are correctly specified.
### Example
An example of using the code is provided in the main function of the script. You can modify the paths to the data files and adjust the hyperparameters according to your requirements.

## Note
This code is designed for anomaly detection in time-series data and assumes that anomalies correspond to low likelihood scores generated by the GAN.
Additional modifications to the model architecture and hyperparameters may be necessary depending on the specific dataset and anomaly detection requirements.
